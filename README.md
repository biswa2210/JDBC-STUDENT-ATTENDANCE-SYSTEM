## About :point_down: 
Student attendance management system deal with the maintenance of the student’s attendance details. It is generates the attendance of the student on basis of presence in class. It is maintaining daily basis of attendance, the staff will be provide with the separate username and password to make student attendance. The staff handling the particular subject to responsible to make the attendance for all students. Only if the student presents the particular date, the attendance will be calculated. The student attendance report based on monthly and consolidate will be generated. Student Attendance Management System is developed for daily student attendance in schools, colleges and institutes. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. The purpose of developing attendance management system is to computerized the tradition way of taking attendance. Another purpose for developing this software is to generate the report automatically at the end of the session or in the between of the session. The scope of the project is the system on which the software is installed, i.e. the project is developed as a desktop application, and it will work for a particular institute. But later on the project can be modified to operate it online. Attendance Management System basically has two main modules for proper functioning:- First module is admin which has right for creating space for new batch. Any entry of new faculty, Updating in subject if necessary, and sending notice. Second module is handled by the user which can be a faulty or an operator. 

## Purpose :point_down:
The goal of the project is to create a student attendance management system where the students can give the attendance for the respective subjects. The faculty of each subject can track the attendance of every student. Hence there will be efficient management of attendance.

## Use :point_down:

## Future Scopes:point_down:
Rather than designing manually we have made use of computer as once that data’s are input it performs accurate function. There is no chance of fault or miscalculation if the data are feeded correctly. Use of the computers has solved many problems, which are faced while manual calculation. This is not the end but beginning of the versatile, efficient and outsourcing railway reservation system. This is the one which is compatible to all operating system. By making this project we made a small footstep towards the path of progress of platform independent railway reservation system. After successful implementation of Railway Reservation System, it will help to the management for managing task efficiently. This gives satisfactory outputs as per required by the End User. This system also has extensibility feature that allows the users to fulfill their additional requirements in the current system. After testing, the system gives same outputs as expected. Railway Reservation System is made economically, technically sound, and providing Efficiency.
